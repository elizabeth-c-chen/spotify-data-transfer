# Spotify Data Transfer Tool
I created this tool out of a personal wish to copy all my Spotify data to a new account. It allows for copying all playlists owned by a user and copying all saved songs in their library.

### Usage
Run `python3 app.py` and login to Spotify when prompted. See file and helper functions for more information.
