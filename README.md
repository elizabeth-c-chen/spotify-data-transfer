# Spotify Data Transfer Tool
I created this tool out of a personal wish to copy all my Spotify data to a new account. It will enable you to transfer data between two Spotify accounts, which will be referred to by the program as the "source" and "destination" accounts. 

**STATUS:** Currently, transferring your Saved Songs/Library has been implemented. I will soon implement transferring playlists.


**Please note that it worked for me, but there is no error checking so use at your own risk. Happy transferring!**

The steps below outline the transfer process:
  1.	First we require authorization from the source account. A new browser window will open now. Please give access to the program in order to proceed. 
  2.	If you have allowed access, the program will then retrieve all saved tracks from the source account. 
  3.   Once data has been successfully retrieved, you will then authorize the app for the destination account. Please log in with your new account credentials. 
  4.	All songs will then be transferred to the new account.
